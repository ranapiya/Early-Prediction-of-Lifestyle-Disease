# **Heart Disease Prediction Web App**

This is a simple Flask web application for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on user input. The application uses a pre-trained machine learning model that combines Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers. The model was trained on a dataset available in 'new_g40.csv'.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
git clone -  https://github.com/shubhankardutta38/Heart_Disease_Prediction_Using_Python.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd heart-disease-prediction

3. Install the required dependencies

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have Python and Flask installed on your system.
2. Run the Flask application:
   python main.py
3. Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
4. Fill out the form with the required information, and click the "Predict" button to get the prediction result.

## Project Structure
main.py: The main Flask application file containing the web server logic.
templates/index.html: HTML template for the home page and prediction result display.
new_g40.csv: Dataset used for training the machine learning model.
Voting_Classifier_(SVM + Random Forest)_model_data_c1.pkl: Pre-trained machine learning model saved using joblib.

## Dependencies

1. Flask
2. pandas
3. joblib

## Model Details

The application uses a combination of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers for predicting heart disease. The model is loaded from the 'Voting_Classifier_(SVM + Random Forest)_model_data_c1.pkl' file.
