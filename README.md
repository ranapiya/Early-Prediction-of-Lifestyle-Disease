Early prediction allows for timely interventions and lifestyle modifications, potentially preventing the progression of heart disease. This  project explores the various approaches to early prediction, ranging from traditional risk factors to cutting-edge technologies.
The implemented Voting Classifier, combining Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest models, was trained and evaluated on the provided heart disease dataset. 
The model exhibited a commendable performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.91281914
